          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>
            Hello! My name is Sheridan. I recently graduated from the University
            of California with a B.S. in Mathematics and Computer Science. I
            began my journey in bioengineering, however, during an intro course,
            the excitement of turning ideas into tangible programs ignited a
            passion for coding that I hadnâ€™t anticipated. The thrill of
            problem-solving and creating functional software overshadowed my
            initial interest in bioengineering. I am eager to continue this
            journey in a position that will allow me to further develop my
            skillset.

                      In this project, we aimed to select, grow, and screen mutant candidates of Arabidopsis thaliana that exhibit the "hot" phenotype. We began by autoclaving the soil and sterilizing the seeds to ensure a controlled environment. Seeds were initially sown in a petri dish, and once mature seedlings developed, they were carefully transplanted into pots for further growth. To assess the phenotypic variations, we analyzed and compared the stomata and pavement cells of both stagnant and mutant plants using infrared cameras. This approach allowed us to gather detailed data on the physiological differences between the two groups, enhancing our understanding of the traits associated with the "hot" phenotype in Arabidopsis thaliana.

                    The process of glycolysis provides a continuous energy source for cancer cells, fueling their growth and proliferation. The aim of this study was to identify an inhibitor that could effectively disrupt glycolysis, thereby stifling the growth of cancer cells by targeting the key regulatory enzyme, phosphofructokinase-1 (PFK-1). Sulforaphane, a naturally occurring compound found in cruciferous vegetables like broccoli, cabbage, and kale, was investigated for its potential as an inhibitor. As an organic isothiocyanate, sulforaphane has been documented to inhibit PFK-1 activity, which is crucial for energy production in cancer cells. Our results demonstrated that 0.15 mM sulforaphane effectively inhibited PFK-1 activity by 50%, providing promising evidence for its role in potentially controlling glycolysis and, consequently, cancer cell growth.

                        Recently, Marukyu Koyamaen Matcha has gone viral on TikTok and has sold out on every single restock since June. In order to get to the restocks on time, I created this stock tracker of their principal matchas. In order to create this tracker, I webscraped the website using BeautifulSoup 4/ python. This data is stored in an AWS DynamoDB database and is regularly updated through a scheduled EventBridge trigger, which invokes a Lambda function. The stock status is then made accessible via a REST API exposed through API Gateway, which calls another Lambda function to query the database. The front end of the tracker is built using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap 4, and JavaScript fetches the stock data from the API and displays it. Additionally, when any stock status is detected to have changed from out of stock to in stock, a discord bot is triggered to ping a notification in a designated discord channel with the product ID and URL.

                        Over a 10-week period, I collaborated with a team of six to develop a task management application using agile development methodologies. We implemented key features such as contextual tagging for task organization (Home, Work, School, Errands) and a Focus Mode interface to enhance user concentration. To achieve data persistence, we utilized a SQL database, enabling efficient storage and retrieval of user tasks, which ensured that data remained consistent and accessible across sessions. I also designed intuitive UI elements like dropdown menus, date pickers, and options for recurring tasks to improve user interaction. Throughout the project, we employed technologies and principles including XML, Java, Behavior-Driven Development (BDD), unit testing, and continuous integration, while adhering to object-oriented design principles and various design patterns to ensure a robust and maintainable codebase.
